Outline

- Introduction
  - We need nuclear innovation to address 
    - global climate and environmental goals
    - global and domestic security goals
    - to ensure economic competitiveness
  - we need it for advanced reactor design, understanding detector materials  
    and behaviors, potential material diversion, and false positives or 
    negatives in monitoring
  - I build tools that people want to use to predictively design these systems
  - with a focus on tools that work on very large machines
  - outline talk: bg, 3 prongs
 
- background
  - the transport equation (here's what it is)
  - the problems we want to solve are really big: 6D, complex data, physically
    challenging problems. We also might want coupled multiphysics. We can do
    this deterministically or with Monte Carlo; each present pretty big
    challenges
  - Context of existing tools are tuned to predict what we already know. We're
    not in a place where we really can predict new things yet. We really need
    to be able to be, though, so that we can shorten development time and
    really bring change. 

- Algorithms for advanced architectures
  - To do predictive simulation we need a lot of computing power. 
     - Cutting edge hardware; describe the kinds of machines; discuss some
       challenges about using these machines.
     - We've got a lot of old codes that can't use new machines effectively, and
       as the machines become larger and more complex this becomes increasingly true.
  - Work I've done to capitalize on new machines across solution strategies.
    - traditional CPUs: Block Krylov + RQI + MGE
    - heterogeneous architectures: WARP
    - hybrid methods: now possible because of larger memory

- Data
  - issues that we're seeing 
    - can't make good cross sections; 
    - can't get the answer right
  - both data processing and underlying data
  - project to directly measure data and identify where processing isn't working (NIF)

- Data processing
  - challenge: things take too long to transfer, render, and process
  - I've just started thinking about this, but as we've gotten bigger machines
    we've just asked them to dump more stuff.  
    - It takes longer to go through output, render things, etc.
    - What if we worked smarter? Lower volume?
  - can we develop algorithms to interleave calculations and analysis? 
    - smarter management of data. 
    - extra calculations inside of the calculations
    - parts of the calculation might take longer, but you may have less data to
      deal with at the end so it might be more time efficient overall...

- Wrap up: the ideas I've talked about aren't unique to nuclear engineering;
  it's likely you're all facing challenges that are like at least some of
  these. I've talked about what I'm doing to face some of them, hopefully we can 
  build new ideas together...
