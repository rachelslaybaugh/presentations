abstract = {Three main streams of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), probabilistic optimization algorithms based on the model of natural evolution, are compared in this article: evolution strategies (ESs), evolutionary programming (EP), and genetic algorithms (GAs). The comparison is performed with respect to certain characteristic components of EAs: the representation scheme of object variables, mutation, recombination, and the selection operator. Furthermore, each algorithm is formulated in a high-level notation as an instance of the general, unifying basic algorithm, and the fundamental theoretical results on the algorithms are presented. Finally, after presenting experimental results for three test functions representing a unimodal and a multimodal case as well as a step function with discontinuities, similarities and differences of the algorithms are elaborated, and some hints to open research questions are sketched.},

This book reviews and introduces the state-of-the-art nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms for global optimization, including ant and bee algorithms, bat algorithm, cuckoo search, differential evolution, firefly algorithm, genetic algorithms, harmony search, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing and support vector machines. In this revised edition, we also include how to deal with nonlinear constraints. Worked examples with implementation have been used to show how each algorithm works. This book is thus an ideal textbook for an undergraduate and/or graduate course as well as for self study. As some of the algorithms such as the cuckoo search and firefly algorithms are at the forefront of current research, this book can also serve as a reference for researchers.},

abstract = {Multiplicative regression model or accelerated failure time model, which becomes linear regression model after logarithmic transformation, is useful in analyzing data with positive responses, such as stock prices or life times, that are particularly common in economic/financial or biomedical studies. Least squares or least absolute deviation are among the most widely used criterions in statistical estimation for linear regression model. However, in many practical applications, especially in treating, for example, stock price data, the size of relative error, rather than that of error itself, is the central concern of the practitioners. This paper offers an alternative to the traditional estimation methods by considering minimizing the least absolute relative errors for multiplicative regression models. We prove consistency and asymptotic normality and provide an inference approach via random weighting. We also specify the error distribution, with which the proposed least absolute relative errors estimation is efficient. Supportive evidence is shown in simulation studies. Application is illustrated in an analysis of stock returns in Hong Kong Stock Exchange.},

A number of {\&}ldquo;no free lunch{\&}rdquo; (NFL) theorems are presented which establish that for any algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class. These theorems result in a geometric interpretation of what it means for an algorithm to be well suited to an optimization problem. Applications of the NFL theorems to information-theoretic aspects of optimization and benchmark measures of performance are also presented. Other issues addressed include time-varying optimization problems and a priori {\&}ldquo;head-to-head{\&}rdquo; minimax distinctions between optimization algorithms, distinctions that result despite the NFL theorems' enforcing of a type of uniformity over all algorithms},

abstract = {The growing power of computers enabled techniques coined for design and analysis of simulations to be applied to a large spectrum of problems and to reach high level of acceptance among practitioners. Generally, when simulations are time consuming, a surrogate model replaces the computer code in further studies. The very first step for successful surrogate modeling and statistical analysis is the planning of the input configuration that will be used to exercise the simulation code. Among strategies coined for computer experiments, Latin hypercube designs have become particularly popular. This paper provides a short overview of the research in Latin hypercube design of experiments, highlighting potential reasons of its widespread use. The discussion starts with the early developments in optimization of the point selection and goes all the way to the pitfalls of always using Latin hypercube designs for selecting experimental designs. Then, final thoughts are given on how the Latin hypercube design fits in the state of the art as well as opportunities for future research.},

abstract = {A new heuristic approach for minimizing possibly nonlinear and non-differentiable con- tinuous space functions is presented. By means of an extensive testbed it is demonstrated that the new method converges faster and with more certainty than many other acclaimed global optimization methods. The new method requires few control variables, is robust, easy to use, and lends itself very well to parallel computation.},

abstract = {A new robust optimisation algorithm, which can be regarded as a modification of the recently developed cuckoo search, is presented. The modification involves the addition of information exchange between the top eggs, or the best solutions. Standard optimisation benchmarking functions are used to test the effects of these modifications and it is demonstrated that, in most cases, the modified cuckoo search performs as well as, or better than, the standard cuckoo search, a particle swarm optimiser, and a differential evolution strategy. In particular the modified cuckoo search shows a high convergence rate to the true global minimum even at high numbers of dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The numerical optimization problem solving successes of the mentioned algorithms have also been compared statistically by testing over 50 differ- ent benchmark functions. Empirical results reveal that the problem solving success of the CK algorithm is very close to the DE algorithm. The run-time complexity and the required function-evaluation number for acquiring globalminimizer by theDE algorithm is generally smaller than the comparison algorithms.The performances of theCKandPSOalgorithms are statistically closer to the performance of the DE algorithm than the ABC algorithm. The CK andDE algorithms supplymore robust and precise results than the PSO andABCalgorithms.},

The proposed approach uses a relatively simple method to handle constraints and a different mechanism to update the velocity and position of each panicle. The algorithm is validated using four standard engineering design problems reported in the specialized literature and it is compared with respect to algorithms representative of the state-of-the-art in the area. Our results indicate that the proposed scheme is a promising alternative to solve this sort of problems because it obtains good results with a low number of objective functions evaluations.},

The overall procedure of measuring and unfolding the fast neutron energy spectra with BC501A liquid scintillation detector is described. The recoil proton spectrum of Am-Be neutrons was obtained experimentally. With the NRESP7 code, the response matrix of detector was simulated. Combining the recoil proton spectrum and response matrix, the unfolding of neutron spectra was performed by GRAVEL iterative algorithm. A MatLab program based on the GRAVEL method was developed. The continuous neutron spectrum of Am-Be source and monoenergetic neutron spectrum of D-T source have been unfolded successfully and are in good agreement with their standard reference spectra. The unfolded Am-Be spectrum are more accurate than the spectra unfolded by artificial neural networks in recent years.},

Calculations can be made with the computer program CYFP. Estimates of uncertainities in the yield estimates are given by equations, also in CYFP, and range from {\~{}} 15{\%} for the highest yield values to several orders of magnitude for very small yield values.
